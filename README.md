# AI-Virtual-Mouse-
The AI Virtual Mouse is a computer vision project developed using OpenCV (cv2) and MediaPipe libraries, aimed at reducing the risk of spreading COVID-19 by minimizing
the need for physical contact with computer peripherals. The project was designed to enable users to control their computers without the need for a physical mouse or
touchpad, using only hand gestures.

The AI Virtual Mouse operates by analyzing real-time video input from a webcam and identifying the user's hand movements. It then translates these movements into mouse
cursor movements, clicks, and scrolling actions, allowing users to interact with their computers without physically touching a mouse or touchpad. The system also
includes a virtual keyboard that allows users to type without touching their physical keyboard.

The project was developed with the goal of reducing the spread of COVID-19 by minimizing the need for people to touch shared surfaces, such as computer mice and
keyboards. By enabling people to control their computers without touching these surfaces, the AI Virtual Mouse reduces the risk of virus transmission and promotes good
hygiene practices.

The AI Virtual Mouse is easy to use and requires only a standard webcam and a computer with the required libraries installed. The system is highly customizable, allowing
users to adjust the sensitivity of the hand-tracking algorithms to suit their needs. Additionally, the project is open-source and freely available, making it accessible
to anyone who wants to use or modify it for their own purposes.

Overall, the AI Virtual Mouse is an innovative solution to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. By enabling users to control their computers without physical
contact with peripherals, it promotes good hygiene practices and helps to reduce the risk of virus transmission.
